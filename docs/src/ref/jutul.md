# Documentation from Jutul.jl

`JutulDarcy.jl` builds upon `Jutul.jl`, which takes care of the heavy lifting in terms of meshes, discretizations and solvers. You can use `JutulDarcy.jl` without
knowing the inner workings of `Jutul.jl`, but if you want to dive under the hood the [Jutul.jl manual](https://sintefmath.github.io/Jutul.jl/dev/) and [Jutul.jl docstrings](https://sintefmath.github.io/Jutul.jl/dev/docstrings/) may be useful.

We include the docstrings here for your convenience:

```@autodocs
Modules = [Jutul, Jutul.ConvergenceMonitors]
```
